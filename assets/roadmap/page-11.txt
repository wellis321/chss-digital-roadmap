INTEGRATING OUR SYSTEMS
TO GIVE US LIVE DATA
We use different systems across different areas and teams within CHSS. The
systems serve specific purposes however this means we have crucial data
stored in different places. We’re not proposing moving from these systems
as these provide vital support. But a priority is for us to investigate how we
collate this data to provide us with a 360-degree view of CHSS’s activities
and reach.
We are starting a project to develop a data warehouse solution, which
will allow us to bring our data across systems together into one view.
This would allow us to gather more insights and have live, real-time data
available across our dashboards.
