WHAT THE CHANGE
WILL ALLOW
Delivering a digital tool for CHSS is about amplifying and increasing the reach of our existing services and making
the work of our team even more impactful. We’ve just started a full co-design exercise but we’re envisaging:
Service recommendations
Matching an individual’s circumstances and profile to
CHSS services and giving rich recommendations to
services that would benefit them.
Progress tracking
Ability to track progress through services and view
progress. Course completion, group attendance,
Kindness call progress and goal/step completion.
Self-referral route
The ability for an individual to self-refer into CHSS and
start accessing services and resources immediately,
empowering them to take ownership of their condition
or prevention
Self-service offering
The ability to provide digital versions of our face-to-
face offerings, opening up access to those who cannot
attend sessions due to location or other factors.
Service user power and transparency
An ability for individuals to view and manage their
information and permissions.
Appointment management
An ability for individuals to view appointment
schedules, book or change appointments and
manage their care.
Keep people coming back
Through the use of push notifications and
gamification we can help motivate people to stay
on track with their goals and amplify the time in-
between appointments with the CHSS team.
Provide live reporting
Live, dissectible reporting across the organisation.
Giving visibility of service usage, service user
engagement, volunteering and more.
Integration with wider healthcare
A system that’s setup to integrate with wider healthcare systems, such as enabling faster, more direct referrals
from hospitals and GPs. The plans in this roadmap will enable us to connect seamlessly with partner systems
for a more efficient flow of information and allow us to further demonstrate the value we add.
