INTEGRATING
FURTHER
One of the benefits of embracing digital is the ability to integrate with
external services and any development can be taken with future
integrations in mind.
Two examples are:
Health and social care referral
For example, we can build a system that would allow pre-loaded referrals
and integration with services like Vision, used by GPs across Scotland. This
would allow GPs to potentially select a number of CHSS services they
recommend for their service user and push a referral link that could allow
that CHSS to invite that individual to the self management app with their
basic details and recommended services already preloaded.
Government scot account
Scottish government are developing their ‘Scot account’ which offers
individuals a single account to access services and hold their digital record.
It may be possible to integrate with Scot account to allow a straightforward
and joined up service aligned with Scottish Government’s development.
It would also allow for basic health information to be shared and allow
CHSS to access valuable information on the individual’s health and
wellbeing to help tailor service and provide better care. In addition this
would follow the principal of ‘tell your story once’ for service users to ease
friction on referral routes and service access.
