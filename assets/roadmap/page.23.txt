DEVELOPING OUR
WEBSITE
Our website is a key communications channel and way for people to find
out more about about CHSS and our services. We also have our online
shop and other websites that host our eLearning modules.
We’ve made some great improvements to our web infrastructure and
security, and we’re continuing to develop the look and feel of our websites
by updating existing page templates and creating new ones.
As our roadmap develops, we’ll consider all options for integrations –
including with our learning management system and self management
app. We’ll work with other teams to improve user journeys and ensure
the design is consistent with our other digital offerings. And our eLearning
website content will be migrated to our learning management system.
