GOVERNANCE AND
MONITORING
It’s important that we ensure good governance throughout the
implementation of our digital roadmap.
This includes the monitoring and delivery of the roadmap itself – by using
project management software to track progress and deliverables, and
ensuring it aligns with our annual team planning, actions and targets.
But it also means that we will follow good practice across data and cyber
security, including getting relevant certifications and undertaking regular
external testing.
As we adapt and develop our digital platforms and user journeys, we’ll
ensure we collect appropriate consents so that we’re transparent with how
we manage and use data. We will need to consider how we handle having
service user-facing records as we develop our self management app – but
this isn’t a situation unique to CHSS, and others will be having the same
conversations as service user records universally become more digitised.
Monitoring of our roadmap delivery
At each stage of the roadmap, we will be reviewing our progress to
ensure that we are delivering the outcomes expected. We will engage
with stakeholders throughout, and have built in milestones for external
users to test and feedback on the work we're doing.
