DIGITAL INCLUSION
& ACCESSIBILITY
A key driver of building a digital supported self management offer is to be able
to include more people in CHSS’ service offer and to reduce geographical and
demographic variation in service availability.
Digital accessibility and inclusion needs to be held at the forefront of any development
of digital services. At this stage that’s resulted in two principles being established.
Maximise availability
Any tool should be built as a browser-based web system as well as a mobile app to
ensure the tool can be accessed without the need for a personal smart phone and be
available to as many people as possible.

Maximise accessibility
We are committed to ensuring that our digital health tool is accessible to everyone. This
will likely include steps to make our tool usable by everyone, including:
• Conforming to WCAG 2.1 Level AA: We have designed our tool to meet the Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA, which provides a set of standards
for making web content accessible to people with disabilities.
• Providing alternative text for images: All images on our tool have descriptive
alternative text, which is important for people who are blind or have low vision.
• Using clear and consistent language: We have used clear and simple language
throughout our tool to make it easy to understand for people with cognitive disabilities.
• Providing keyboard navigation: Our tool can be fully navigated using a keyboard,
which is important for people who cannot use a mouse.
It is also important to highlight that this is being proposed as a service enhancement
rather than a service replacement. Existing pathways and non-digital routes to access
services will of course remain for those unwilling or unable to access services and
resources digitally.
