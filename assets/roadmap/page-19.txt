WP 30X
Things change quickly in digital, and it gets harder
to predict priorities and activities the further in the
future we go.
As with phase 2, future packages will be defined
throughout the process. At phase 3 a further
review will need to be taken of CHSS’s direction
as well as changes in the data, service user
records, and self management space.
This will allow us to understand if any adaptations
need to be made to CHSS’s direction of travel or if
any opportunities have arisen that weren’t evident
when starting this journey.
